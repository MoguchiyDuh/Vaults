## Definition
A sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed number.
### $$\boxed{a,ar,ar^2,ar^3,...}$$

---
## Notation
- **n**: Size (number of terms)
- **a**: First term ($a_1$)
- **r**: Common ratio
- **S**: Sum of terms

## N-th Term
The formula to find the $n$-th term of a geometric progression is:
### $$\boxed{a_n = a_1  \cdot r^{n-1}}$$

---

## Sum of First n Terms #formula
The sum of the first $n$-terms can be calculated using the following formula:

### $$\boxed{S_n = a_1 \cdot \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \quad \text{(for $ r \neq 1 $)}}$$

### Special Case ($r = 1$): $$\boxed{S_n = n \cdot a_1}$$

## Infinite Sum (Convergent Series)
For an infinite geometric series where $|r| < 1$, the sum converges to:
### $$\boxed{S_\infty = \frac{a_1}{1 - r}}$$
