## Sine Rule  #sine_rule #formula
The Sine Rule relates the sides of a triangle to the sines of its opposite angles:
### $$\boxed{\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)} = 2R}$$
Where:
- $R$ is the radius of the circumcircle of the triangle.

### Applications:
- Use the Sine Rule when you know:
  - Two angles and one side (to find another side).
  - Two sides and a non-included angle (to find another angle).
