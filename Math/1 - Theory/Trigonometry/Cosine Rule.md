## Cosine Rule #cosine_rule #formula
The Cosine Rule relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles:
### $$\boxed{c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos(C)}$$
Alternatively:
### $$\boxed{a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos(A)}$$
### $$\boxed{b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac\cos(B)}$$

### Applications:
- Use the Cosine Rule when you know:
  - All three sides (to find an angle).
  - Two sides and the included angle (to find the third side).
