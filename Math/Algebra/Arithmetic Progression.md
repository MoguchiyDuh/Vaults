### Definition
A sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant.
### $$\boxed{a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d,...}$$

---
## Notation
- **n**: Size (number of terms)
- **a**: Term ($a_n$: *n*-th term)
- **S**: Sum of terms
- **d**: Common difference

---

## N-th Term
The formula to find the *n*-th term of an arithmetic progression is:
### $$\boxed{a_n = a_1 + d(n - 1)}$$

---

## Sum of First n Terms #formula
The sum of the first *n* terms can be calculated using one of the following formulas:

### $$\boxed{S_n = \frac{a_1 + a_n}{2} \cdot n}$$

<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">OR</p>

### $$\boxed{S_n = \frac{2a_1 + d(n - 1)}{2} \cdot n}$$
