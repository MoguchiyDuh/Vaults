## Definition
A **quadratic function** is a second-degree [[Polynomials|polynomial]] function
The general form of a quadratic equation is:
### $$\boxed{ax^2 + bx + c = 0}$$
<p style="text-align: center;">where:  x &ne; 0</p>

## Notation
- $D$: Discriminant
- $x_{1,2}$: Roots
- $a, b, c$: Coefficients

## Discriminant #discriminant
The discriminant determines the nature of the roots:
### $$\boxed{D = b^2 - 4ac}$$
- **Case 1**: $D > 0$: The equation has **2 distinct real solutions** and can be factorized:

### $$\boxed{ax^2 + bx + c = a(x-x_1)(x-x_2)}$$
- **Case 2**: $D = 0$: The equation has **1 real solution** (a repeated root, can be found using #square_identities ).
- **Case 3**: $D < 0$: The equation has **no real solutions** ($\varnothing$).

### Roots #roots_of_square_equation
The roots of the quadratic equation are given by:
### $$\boxed{x_{1,2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a}}$$

## Vieta's formula #vietas_formula
- ### Sum: $$\boxed{x_1 + x_2 = \frac{-b}{a}}$$
- ### Product: $$\boxed{x_1 x_2 = \frac{c}{a}}$$
