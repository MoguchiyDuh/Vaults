## Purpose
Simplifies Boolean algebra expressions visually to create optimal logic circuits.

## Basic Rules

### Grouping
- Rectangles only (2^n cells: 1,2,4,8)
- Maximize group size
- Minimize number of groups
- Groups can wrap around edges (top-bottom, left-right)
- Overlapping groups are allowed

### Reading Groups
- Identify variables that **don't change** within the group
- Eliminate variables that **change** within the group
- Within **one** group: variables are **multiplied** (AND) → ABCD
- Between **different** groups: terms are **added** (OR) → AB + CD

## 4-Variable K-Map

**Solution:**
We have 3 groups:
- orange group: $A \land D$
- green group: $C \land D$
- Purple group: $\lnot B \land \lnot D$

**Result:** $(A \land D) \lor (C \land D) \lor (\lnot B \land \lnot D)$

## Limitations
Beyond 6 variables becomes **impractical**. Use Quine-McCluskey algorithm instead.
